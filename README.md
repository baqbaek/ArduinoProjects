--DISCLAIMER--

All of the comments done in code are in polish language due to my supervisor's request.
I always try to write code only in English.:)

3rd- a program that turns on LEDs one by one, turning off the previous one. <br/>
4th- "hit or miss" game <br/>
5th- a program that turns on LEDs using a potentiometer and dims them when a certain voltage is reached. <br/>
6th- controlling a servo using 4 potentiometers <br/>
7th- a program that checks the current temperature and the value of light<br/>
8th- "parking sensor"	<br/>
